# About My First Project
This project is designed to evaluate the academic performance of students over a specific school term or academic period.
It allows a teacher to: Input students' test and exam scores, the number of times school opened in session, and the number of times a student was absent.
Using this data, the system helps determine whether each student qualifies for promotion to the next class based on their academic performance and attendance.
This tool aims to simplify and streamline the evaluation process, making it more objective, data-driven, and transparent.
